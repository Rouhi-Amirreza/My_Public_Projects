Ok, now I want you to add a new page to the app called “Plan Optimizer” for expense management companies (specifically in the travel expense section). This page will help manage and optimize employees’ business trips.

🔹 Core Functionality
The user (agent or employee) should be able to:
* Enter their meetings, venues, or conferences, including:
    * Meeting name
    * Address and city
    * Start date/time and end date/time
The app should then find the best flights that:
1. Satisfy all meeting time constraints
2. Comply with company travel policies

🔹 Settings to Include
Add input fields for the following configurable settings:
* Driving Time to Airport
* Meeting Start Date & Time
* Meeting End Date & Time
* Arrival Flexibility (days before meeting):
    * MinArrivalFlexibility (minimum days before)
    * MaxArrivalFlexibility (maximum days before)
* Departure Flexibility (days after meeting):
    * MinDepartureFlexibility (minimum days after)
    * MaxDepartureFlexibility (maximum days after)

🔹 Flight Filter Options
Support the following optional filters (matching SerpAPI parameters):
* include_airlines → Include Airlines
* exclude_airlines → Exclude Airlines
* travel_class → Travel Class
* currency → Currency
* outbound_times → Preferred Outbound Times
* return_times → Preferred Return Times
* layover_duration (minutes) → Parameter defines the layover duration, in minutes. It's a string containing two comma-separated numbers. For example, specify 90,330 for 1 hr 30 min - 5 hr 30 min.
Refer to:
* https://serpapi.com/google-flights-api
* SerpAPI Google Flights Airports
In this regard, you can also use the settings we have in SerpAPI such as outbound_times and return_times, but apply them only to the exact day(s) that the meeting or venue occurs, to ensure flights match the meeting’s required time window.

🔹 Logic & Architecture
You can reuse the multi-city tab architecture, but modify the logic as follows:
1. Find the first flight that satisfies:
    * Meeting filters and company rules
    * Arrival time < (meeting start time − driving time)
    * Flight date within [meeting_date − MaxArrivalFlexibility, meeting_date − MinArrivalFlexibility]
2. For subsequent meetings:
    * Departure time of next flight must be after (previous meeting end time + driving time + 3 hours) (3 hours = airport buffer, configurable)
    * Arrival time < (next meeting start time − driving time)
    * Flight date within [next_meeting_date − MaxArrivalFlexibility, next_meeting_date − MinArrivalFlexibility]
3. Time constraints apply only to meeting days.
    * For example, if a meeting is on Oct 23 and ArrivalFlexibility = 1–2, flights arriving between Oct 21–22 are allowed any time, but if it’s on Oct 23, the flight must satisfy the meeting-time conditions.
4. Continue this logic sequentially for all meetings.
    * For each combination of flights satisfying all constraints, store and display the valid flight sets.

✅ Output
The app should display all valid flight combinations that meet:
* Time and flexibility constraints
* Company filters and travel policies
Each combination should show:
* Departure/arrival times
* Total duration
* Airline, travel class, and layover details
